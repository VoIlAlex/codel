# Codel üç≤

Count lines of your code tastefully.

## Getting started

Before you start you should install:

- Python 3.x
- pip

## Installation

Enter this in your terminal:

```bash
pip install codel
```

## Usage

To count lines of files with extensions `.py` `.cpp` and `.h` enter this in your terminal:

```bash
codel count -e .py .cpp .h
```

To ignore files or folders use `-i` flag:

```bash
codel count -e .py -i test/**
```

### Configuration

It's possible to set default's for folder so you can use codel without flags. To manage your folder configuration use `config` command:

```bash
codel config -e .py -i test/**
```

If you want to apply the configuration globally you should use `-g` flag:

```bash
codel config -g -e .py -i test/**
```
